# Water Consumption Prediction Project

## About the Project
Water is something we all need every day, but with cities expanding, it is becoming harder to manage. This project shows how machine learning can be used to predict how much water will be used in households. By knowing this in advance, we can save more water and plan better for the future.

## What I Did
- Collected the dataset and explored it,  
- Cleaned missing and wrong values,  
- Used Python libraries for analysis,  
- Built a model with machine learning,  
- Measured accuracy using error metrics.  

## Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## Outcome
The model predicts water usage based on different factors such as household and environment. This can help reduce wastage and improve water management.

## Next Steps
- Try stronger models to improve results,  
- Build a simple tool where users can input their data,  
- Use real sensor data in the future.
